# SIMPLE STORE

Application management in Linux is never easy for normies moving from other platforms.
CLI package manager is a no go for them because they are scared of black screen with 
text only. GUI stores exist but still complex and not Linus-proof. Normies just expect
things to just work, and never care about technical behind.

Simple Store aims to free normies from these issues yet still able to use Linux as daily
driver operating system.
